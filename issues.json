(With all of the range restrictions on those types?)\r\n\r\nThe example at hand is Decimals -- since the \"Serialize a Decimal\" algorithm states that its input is a decimal, should rounding even be a possible concern? According to 3.3.2, decimals can only have three fractional digits. Unless that algorithm actually accepts arbitrary real numbers, the issue of rounding, or of the integer component being too large, should never come up.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, after saying \"Given a byte sequence as input_bytes, ...\", the \"Serializing a Byte Sequence\" algorithm includes \"If input_bytes is not a sequence of bytes, ...\", which seems like an impossible situation.\r\n\r\nStrings, tokens, and keys all do the same, guarding against situations which can't happen if the input is the correct structured data type (as opposed to a generic string in the implementation language.)\r\n\r\nI don't know if the spec just needs to be more precise about when it is talking about Structured Data Strings, Tokens, Decimals, etc., or if the serialization algorithms need to be defined as taking generic strings, numbers, and arrays as input, or maybe we need both, with a section on converting strings to Strings or Tokens, numbers to Decimals, etc., which can happen before or during serialization.\r\n\r\n(Or maybe I'm being too strict here, and the threshold for spec text should be 'understandable by a reasonable person'? :) )"

    "body": "The [explanation of the rationale behind assigning semantics to priority levels](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#why-do-urgencies-have-meanings) is not especially convincing.\r\n\r\nThe idea that we might have consistent labeling of priorities is something this shares with DSCP, but there the semantics are given more precise semantics than this document does for its levels.  If these semantics are to carry any weight, then it needs to be really clear what the client might expect a server to do with each different value.  It seems to me that if a server was to complete all requests at priority N before allocating anything other than opportunistic resources to N+1 then you get pretty much the semantics as described.  Priority 0 gets completed first, and 7 last.\r\n\r\nThe idea that different clients might share an understanding of different values is nice, but for that to work you need to trust that clients will label things similarly.  Right now, I don't see any incentive to do so.  If one implementation were to shift their priorities one higher or one lower, the effect probably wouldn't be any different.\r\n\r\nI do strongly agree with the idea that the number of buckets needs to be small.  8 is a reasonable number on balance.  But the associated trappings need far stronger motivation.\r\n\r\nKeep the last paragraph of that section though.  That concept deserves greater prominence in the document.  It does that by largely contradicting the argument for assigned semantics though."

Instead, I would prefer that we say that when an intermediary coalesces requests from multiple clients, servers need to be aware of that and account for that in their processing.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this text is fine in the sense that it identifies information the server can use to more fairly allocate resources to different requests, but - again - this is just information the server uses when making prioritization decisions.\r\n\r\nThe model we operate on should not assume be that Priority is an instruction to the server, but that it provides the server (or intermediary) clues about how it might decide to allocate resources."

    "body": "There has been some debate about the relative utility of frames as a means of prioritizing and reprioritizing requests.  \r\n\r\nFrames are not guaranteed to be end-to-end and don't enjoy the benefits listed in [Section 8.1](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-priority.html#why-use-an-end-to-end-header-field).  An (unlisted) reason is that the API for header fields is better understood and more likely to be available than a new and unspecified API.  HTTP/2 defined the use of frames for reprioritization, but APIs are not widely available, nor are they consistent.\r\n\r\nFrames provide two obvious benefits:\r\n\r\n1. They are scoped to the current connection and so only propagate if the receiving endpoint explicitly propagates them.\r\n\r\n2. They can be sent at any time.  This allows for reprioritization, but the requirement to have them sent after requests are complete means that they can't be sent \"on\" a stream, they have to instead refer to a stream, which complicates the design somewhat.  The proposal to allow trailers at any time helps a little here, but only to the extent that it remains possible to send.  Stream closure is used to terminate request bodies in some cases, making any trailer-based solution limited.\r\n\r\nHowever, frames have shortcomings too:\r\n\r\n1. They are complex.  The encoding of a header field into a frame is suboptimal, but necessary for extensibility and consistency reasons.  And the manner in which they refer to requests (or pushes) makes them more complex to manage than a header field.\r\n\r\n2. They are only scoped to a connection, which means that the extent of propagation can be non-deterministic.  In particular, they depend on the connection supporting the signaling.  This is the flip side of the benefit, and - in my opinion - outweighs it.\r\n\r\n3. The API is far more difficult compared to header fields.\r\n\r\nWe know little enough about the efficacy of prioritization that we should defer the definition of frames absent strong motivation for their efficacy and desirability.  The current document makes a good case for header fields, but the motivation for frames is weaker.  It is true that cases like escalation of a speculative fetch to blocking status are *theoretically* appealing, but those cases are rare and unlikely to benefit from reprioritization.  In particular, the mismatch between end-to-end and hop-by-hop (excuse the use of deprecated terminology) characteristics here makes it very hard to reason about the outcome.\r\n\r\nI know that others (@RyanAtGoogle in particular) have questions about the header field from a different angle and would prefer frames, exclusively.  So this probably comes down to having more discussion about which approach to take: headers, frames, or both.  \r\n\r\nIn either case, I would suggest that we have a need for both clear signals that the mechanism is broadly useful and evidence that that it is likely to be widely implemented.\r\n"

    "body": "The last time I reviewed this spec it had essentially a single key, the header itself, and an enum of possible values, which would be repeated if the response passed through multiple cache layers:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncache-action   = %s\"HIT_FRESH\"\r\n               / %s\"HIT_STALE\"\r\n               / %s\"HIT_REFRESH_MODIFIED\"\r\n               / %s\"HIT_REFRESH_NOT_MODIFIED\"\r\n               / %s\"HIT_REFRESH_STALE\"\r\n               / %s\"MISS\"\r\n               / %s\"MISS_CLIENT\"\r\n               / %s\"BYPASS\"\r\n               / %s\"ERROR\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere was certainly scope to make this more detailed, but it seemed elegant enough and was essentially a like for lie replacement of what most caches already do.  The current version goes too far in my opinion.  I see the following use cases:\r\n\r\n1. Developer of site using the header interactively for debugging\r\n2. Developers' CI tools asserting expected behaviours against the header for smoke testing\r\n3. Developers monitoring their CDN partner's cache efficacy (via RUM, I guess, ideally)\r\n4. Cache operators optimising their behaviour based on a better understanding of upstream cache status\r\n5. Researchers wanting to understand the state of the web more generally\r\n\r\nMany of these use cases arguably call for the most granular and detailed possible information to be included, but I would argue that 95% of the value of this type of header is use case 1.  And in the latest revision, we have lost a simple, clear status token.\r\n\r\nI'd propose reintroducing an enum of statuses, and support the additional params as enrichment. So a complexish example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nCache-Status: MISS; cache=fastly-bwi-1234; collapse-hit=?1,\r\n              HIT_FRESH; cache=akamai; res-fresh=289\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe current proposal already has a keyless param, for the cache name.  I'm essentially proposing that we add a key to that param, and introduce a new keyless param, for the summary cache status.\r\n\r\nThe result is that this is MUCH easier for developers to scan, a minimal implementation is more immediately useful (because as a cache you need only implement the keyless status param, not any of the others) and therefore implementation/adoption could be faster.  A minmal example could be (exactly as per the earlier spec draft):\r\n\r\n```\r\nCache-Status: HIT_FRESH\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhereas the minimal implementation of the current draft would be something like `Cache-Status: ExampleCache` and (at least for use case 1) that's unlikely to tell anyone anything they don't already know."

    "body": "For a very long time (since early 1995) there have been various attempts to send metadata in parallel with the request or response bodies. The use cases have ranged from group chat to chained digital signatures to performance metrics to long download checkpoints to a heck of a lot of other things that I pretend to no longer remember for sanity purposes.\r\n\r\nFixing that in HTTP/1.1 was only possible within chunked extensions. For a variety of reasons that had nothing to do with the use cases, chunked extensions didn't work well over intermediaries and the chicken never hatched. Nevertheless, they did work over HTTP/1.1 when the applications had control over both sides of a connection. I vaguely recall such metadata being present in HTTPng as well.\r\n\r\nI would like for HTTP/2 to have a mechanism for communicating metadata (like trailers) in mid-stream, both for requests (e.g., priority) and responses (e.g., chained sigs).\r\n\r\nI believe that this can be done with an extension frame type that carries trailer data, just like HEADERS, but that doesn't imply the end of DATA. However, I don't really have an opinion on what is the right way to do this in HTTP/2. I'd appreciate if people more familiar with HTTP/2 extensions could choose the best specific syntax.\r\n\r\nThis is not a semantics change for HTTP because the fields are just optional trailers that arrive early. A recipient that is not prepared to handle these fields, for whatever reason, can discard them in the same way as trailers, as specified in http-core [Semantics](/httpwg/http-core/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-latest.html).\r\n\r\nRelated to quicwg/base-drafts#3265"

    "body": "(Related to now-closed #896)\r\n\r\nShould implementations be able to store parsed floats in IEEE754 binary64? And if so, should we expect that they round trip between parsing and serialization? It seems like the current limits were designed to support that notion, but there are cases where they do not.\r\n\r\n(Note, this isn't about being able to serialize arbitrary C++ doubles; the spec sensibly only supports a tiny subset of all possible 64-bit floats. This is about whether `x == Serialize(Parse(x))` should always be true)\r\n\r\nIEEE 754 guarantees that if a string with no more than 15 digits is converted to a double and then back to a string, it should result in the original string, but that appears to require rounding in some cases; truncation, which the serialization algorithm calls for, can change the string representation.\r\n\r\nParsing the string \"12345678901234.1\" as a float, for instance, results in a binary64 representation with value 0x42a674e79c5fe433, whose exact decimal expansion is 12345678901234.099609375. Following the text of the serialization algorithm, `fractional_digits_avail` will be 1, and so the number will be serialized as \"12345678901234.0\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, as an implementer, that the only way to ensure that a float parsed from a valid string can be serialized back to the original string is to store it as a fixed point decimal in two parts, or else use a float with >64 bits of precision for storage."

We can expand on these further if needs be.\r\n\r\nI wanted to break out the SRI stuff, but ran out of time today to fully complete that so the PR is WIP.\r\n\r\nFinally, the usage in signatures section seemed to benefit from some tidy up too.

A discovery mechanism that allows the client to probe the server for the set of digests it supports (client and server specifically)\r\n2. A unilateral advertisement of the algorithms supported by the sending endpoint\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut to try and understand if it is 1) or 2) I see nothing in RFC 3230 that prescribes behaviour like this but I may well have missed it. Either way I don't think we should be putting normative text (MAY reply) in the section header. \r\n\r\nSo lets decouple things.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming in this example case that we operate under the model that server is allowed to respond with a 4xx under any circumstance. But specifically in this case the server is unwilling to accept requests with `sha` algorithm.\r\n\r\nThen next it advertises the list of algorithms it can generate? In which case, a header names Want-Digest is not very inutuitive. It seems to act asymmetrically, while we are expending a lot of effort to understand and describe how Digest can be used in Request and Response."

    "body": "Client hints might be most useful in some types of requests and not others.  Clients might choose to limit which hints are sent with requests based on contextual information.\r\n\r\nFor instance, hints that apply to presentation like DPR are less applicable to resource loads for javascript or json objects.  Though I'm sure that someone can come up with a use case for almost anything in almost any context, the cost (#962), small as it might be, is probably not always justified in the aggregate.  So the draft should probably say that *for a given hint* opting in to clients hints might be either:\r\n\r\n1. constrained by the UA to apply only to similar requests to the one where the hint has been requested, or \r\n\r\n2. only sent for requests made from a specific application context.\r\n\r\nFor (1), this is something that can be applied generically in specifications (like the fetch spec).\r\n\r\nFor (2), the definition of each client hint might provide suggestions.\r\n\r\nThis is probably something that the fetch specification changes need to consider more carefully, but this specification might lay some groundwork for that."

    "body": "A European Union (EU) [directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directive_(European_Union)) requires member states to achieve a result, without dictating specific means. In contrast, EU [regulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrivacy_Regulation_(European_Union)) are binding law in all member states. Recital 25 of the Preamble and Article 5(3) of the [ePrivacy Directive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_and_Electronic_Communications_Directive_2002) (ePD)--often referred to as the EU Cookie Law--regulate the use of cookies. The [ePrivacy Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPrivacy_Regulation_(European_Union)) (ePR) is expected to repeal and replace the ePD in 2019, but it's expected the ePR will regulate the use of cookies in substantially the same manner as the ePD.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase [one summary](https://www.iubenda.com/en/help/5525-cookies-gdpr-requirements), the EU Cookie Law requires the following:\r\n\r\n- Unless an exempt type of cookie, informed consent, based on explicit affirmative action, before storing a cookie on the user's device.\r\n- Conspicuously providing the option for obtaining informed consent.\r\n- A means for withdrawal of consent.\r\n- Ability to prove consent occurred, even if subsequently withdrawn.\r\n- A guarantee, via prior blocking, no tracking performed before consent.\r\n- Informing users of the use of third-party cookies.\r\n- Stating the category and purpose of third-party cookies, even if not listed individually.\r\n- Linking to relevant third-party privacy/cookie policies.\r\n\r\n[RFC 6265](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc6265) doesn't include mechanisms enabling user agents to aid in compliance with the above requirements, and this has resulted in presentation of inconsistently placed, and inconsistently formatted, cookie banners worldwide. Such inconsistency degrades user experience, works against conspicuousness, and is annoying to the point that some have attempted to create [workarounds](https://cookiesok.com/) to address the lack of desired user agent functionality. Internet Draft (I-D) [draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis/) proposes to obsolete RFC 6265; however, it also fails to address the issues raised above.\r\n\r\nAttributes, such as the following, could be added to the Set-Cookie Header:\r\n\r\n- Category (Allows grouping for purpose of category consent.)\r\n- Purpose (Provides information to ensure consent is informed.)\r\n- Exempt (Informs user agent not to prompt for consent.)\r\n- Third-Party (Informs user agent to label cookie as third-party.)\r\n- Policy (Allows linking to third-party privacy/cookie policy.)\r\n\r\nEach user agent could then prompt users for consent in a consistent manner across all servers that implement the standard. Consent could be requested individually, for all cookies all at the same time, or selectively (depending on capabilities of the user agent.)\r\n\r\nIf permissible, such attributes may eventually enable user agents to allow users to provide advance consent, via settings, for selected categories of cookies, for selected purposes, on selected domains. A list of allowable categories and purposes may also need to be standardized before anything other than the ability to accept all cookies for selected domains would be feasible.\r\n\r\nDue to the requirement that servers be able to prove consent occurred, user agents would need to be required to provide a response to that effect, and servers would need to be able to reliably assume requested cookies were not stored if no such response is received. Servers would need a mechanism to ensure older user agents don't automatically store the cookies without prompting for consent, as the existing Set-Cookie Header would be used.\r\n\r\nI'm not yet sure what withdrawal of consent might look like."

The current specification (-03) makes this difficult because all unknown values as parsed as “None” (or “Lax” after [draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-incrementalism-00#section-3))\r\n\r\nIf unknown values were instead ignored, older UAs would fallback onto an earlier declaration, while newer ones would get the new behavior.\r\n\r\nFor instance, a site using FirstPartyStrict could fallback to None, to keep cookies accessible in older browsers, with SameSite=None; SameSite=FirstPartyStrict.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, the site may wish to fallback to Strict, preferring the tighter CSRF protection, via SameSite=Strict; SameSite=FirstPartyStrict.\r\n\r\nIf we added, say, a StrictOnOrigin mode which used same-origin instead of same-site, a site might use SameSite=Strict; SameSite=StrictOnOrigin.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the [draft-02](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-02#section-5.3.7) does this, however [draft-03](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-rfc6265bis-03#section-5.3.7) changed this to unconditionally take the last attribute. Firefox implements -02 while Chrome implements -03 (@chlily1, @martinthomson, @mikewest). Whichever option we choose, we should make sure implementations align.\r\n\r\nBelow are findings comparing how a variety of UAs, along with the above drafts, interpret different combination of SameSite attributes. (@johnwilander, which did you all implement for the new Safari behavior?)\r\n\r\nAll UA results were taken from each UA's dev tools.\r\n\r\n| SameSite Attribute | Draft 02 | Draft 03 | Draft 03 + Inc | Chrome 77 | Firefox 69 | Safari OS X 10.14 |\r\n|-----------------------------------|----------|----------|----------------|-----------|------------|-------------------|\r\n| \" | Unset | Unset | Lax | Unset | Unset | Unset |\r\n| SameSite=garbage | Unset | None | Lax | Unset | Unset | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=garbage; SameSite=None | Unset | None | None | None | Unset | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=garbage; SameSite=Lax | Lax | Lax | Lax | Lax | Lax | Lax |\r\n| SameSite=garbage; SameSite=Strict | Strict | Strict | Strict | Strict | Strict | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=None; SameSite=garbage | Unset | None | Lax | Unset | Unset | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=Lax; SameSite=garbage | Lax | None | Lax | Unset | Lax | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=Strict; SameSite=garbage | Strict | None | Lax | Unset | Strict | Strict |\r\n| SameSite=Lax; SameSite=None | Lax | None | None | None | Unset | Strict |\r\n\r\n"

If that was relevant, would an HTTP/1.1 header field transmitted over TLS still be considered \"textual\"?\r\n\r\nSo minimally there should be a precise definition. On the other hand, it might be simpler just to get rid of them term, and to explain somewhere once that the field value might not be transferred as plain text in  HTTP/1.1, 2, or 3, and maybe that future versions of HTTP might introduce a new binary encoding based on SH."

A natural way to do this in JavaScript would be to treat both as a JavaScript string and depending on the content serialize as one or the other. However, this would mean that if something takes a String that could also be represented as a Token, it gets a Token. And unless consumers are always required to support that, there's a problem.\r\n\r\nAn alternative here is that we do something less ergonomic, but that'll likely end up favoring one of these over the other.\r\n\r\n(Depending on the outcome of #907 for the getter side we might need a wrapper Item object of sorts that could indicate whether something is a string or token and you could use the same on the setter side, but passing a string when setting should probably work as well.)"

Should probably recommend that clients which omit the DNS lookup never solicit secondary server certificates, but probably don't need to mandate anything."

    "body": "Now that we are generalizing how the types are used, I think it might be a good idea to allow a dictionary value to be a mapping (i.e., a list of parameters).\r\n\r\nThis would be a generalization. At the moment, top level elements can contain scalars, lists, or dictionaries. However, it is at the moment impossible to use a dictionary at the second level even though scalars and lists are permitted.\r\n\r\nIn terms of use-case, the proposed change would allow for example something like a cache-control directive to take a mapping as an argument (see https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/824#discussion_r300230506).\r\n\r\nLogic-wise, I assume that the added complexity would not be significant, as we can reuse the definition for the parameters of a parameterised list."

    "body": "Discussion on #816 and #797 makes me wonder whether it would be good to refactor Parameterised Lists to be just Lists -- i.e.:\r\n\r\n* All List items would be allowed to have parameters; a \"bare\" list would just have no parameters\r\n* By necessity, List items would still be able to be any item type (or an inner-list, if #816 goes forward), meaning that #797 would be implemented\r\n* The top-level permissible types would be collapsed down to just `Dictionary` `List` and `Item`.\r\n\r\nThe obvious benefit here is simplification. Another benefit would be future-proofing headers that might need to elaborate on their list items in the future; they can just add new parameters as necessary.\r\n\r\nThe downsides I can see:\r\n* As per discussion in #797, it's no longer simple to map lists to a simple programming language data type, nor to simple JSON. However, I think I could adjust the JSON in the test suite to give us the expressiveness we need here, and I think the wrapper object here is pretty self-explanatory.\r\n* It would require current specs using Parameterised List to re-specify using List. Not a big deal, I think, but worth checking with folks like @mikewest.\r\n* A header that wants any list item to fail parsing if it contains parameters will have to say so explicitly -- but as per above, I think that's the right default.\r\n\r\nWhat do folks think -- worth it?"

This is useful; it allows a recipient to know not only that, but where it _was_ generated (by inspecting `proxy`).\r\n\r\nHowever, there is one exception -- `http_response_status` is explicitly decorating a response that's been forwarded by the origin. \r\n\r\nBesides the _one-of-these-things-is-not-like-the-others_ factor, I suspect this is going to trip some folks up, because they'll log or otherwise act on the presence of the header field with an understanding of \"this response was generated by a proxy, not by the origin.\" Since it's a debugging tool, that's especially concerning.\r\n\r\nI think this could be addressed by moving those use cases into a new header field (still defined by this document; e.g., `Proxy-Info`), but I'm open to other approaches.\r\n\r\n@PiotrSikora I know you had use cases around this, so would be very interested in your take.\r\n"

But I didn't find anything specifically on point, so I'm erring on the side of another issue._\r\n\r\nThe discussion of substructures in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-10#appendix-B.2 is somewhat unsatisfying, as it seems there are a number of cases in which a little support for additional structure would be helpful. In particular, allowing the values of dictionary members to be lists would open up a syntax for a few of the policy headers I'm somewhat responsible for that seems difficult to replicate otherwise.\r\n\r\nEven the example in that section:\r\n\r\n> ```\r\n> Example-Thing: name=\"Widget\", cost=89.2, descriptions=\"foo bar\"\r\n> Example-Description: foo; url=\"https://example.net\"; context=123,\r\n>                      bar; url=\"https://example.org\"; context=456\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nimplicitly treats the `descriptions` member as a space-separated list which requires parsing logic above and beyond what structured headers themselves offer. It seems like a very common pattern, and one which would be hard to layer in after the fact in a v2 if we decide that syntax really would be nice.\r\n\r\nI am 100% sure that y'all considered a syntax like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nExample-Dictionary-Header: ..., memberName=[thing1, thing2, thing3]\r\n```\r\n\r\n(which, of course, could also be used for [lists of lists](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure-10#section-3.3)). I'm not sure why you rejected it. The discussion in #476 seemed to be about the narrow value of allowing parsing without context. I happen to believe that that's actually valuable, but I also think there's both semantic and aesthetic value in explicitly demarcating lists as a primitive that can exist basically anywhere `sh-item` exists in the current spec.\r\n\r\nI'm happy to send a PR and add tests to https://github.com/httpwg/structured-header-tests/ if you'd accept them, conceptually. :)"

    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nbased on the work we did on https://www.w3.org/Submission/viwi-protocol/ I want to request adding new functionality which can be implemented with two new VERBS and two new headers.\r\n\r\n**Use Case:**\r\nClients want to subscribe to `urls`, as topics with all the filtering, paging information etc. being expressed in the `url`. This would allow services to push information into clients whenever it is considered necessary.\r\n\r\n**Implementation:**\r\nAs subscriptions are a \"convenience\" method compared to polling via `GET`, I propose two new HTTP Verbs\r\n\r\n* SUB for subscription to `url`\r\n* UNSUB for un-subscribing from `url`\r\n\r\nTo control the frequency of updates, we would need additional headers:\r\n\r\n* subscription-interval: <timeStepInMs> \r\n* subscription-updatelimit: <timeStepInMs>\r\n\r\n_Periodic_\r\nThe optional interval attribute specifies the update frequency in milliseconds for periodic updates, while the optional updatelimit attribute specifies the maximum update rate in milliseconds for ‘on change’ notification. If interval is set, updatelimit is always overruled.\r\n\r\n_On change_\r\nIf interval is not set, the notification interval is defined ‘on change’ and can be limited by specifying an updatelimit. If an ‘on change’ occours before updatelimit elapsed, an event will be sent as soon as updatelimit elapsed. If there are multiple changes before the next possible update, only the last one know state is sent after updatelimit elapsed.\r\n\r\n**Summary**\r\nAs this is very close to a regular GET, it would be easy and we could also standardise that per each client-server relation, there would just be a single UDP/IP channel for notifications used and held up. We could also specify that this is a \"simplex\" connection regarding payload data. as clients would use other HTTP verbs to send data. Each data sent from the server to the client would be exactly the same as a GET response. Very straight forward from my perspective and a valuable extension of the standard for all things \"realtime\". \r\n\r\nAll the Headers we replicate in WebSockets today.. puuuffff gone ;) we can just plain HTTP headers... \r\n\r\nThe viwi/RSI spec would than be just rewrote to hold the interface design rules etc. the entire WebSocket parts would be obsolete.\r\n\r\nAlso It would than not be relevant anymore wether we transmit JSON (text) or binary content.. \r\n\r\nThink of it as a GET with multiple responses.. same formats, payloads, everything.. just not req/res but req/res/res/res/res... including all status codes etc.\r\n\r\nRe-Auth would also just be another SUB request with a new Token.. super easy ;)\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of solutions discussed and implemented. As described in the spec I reference to, WebSockets are used, replicating some of the HTTP headers and a topic. \r\n\r\nWith this proposal, I want to reduce friction. - ¥ Why setup two sockets, if you can handle it via one?\r\n\r\nThe socket you use for HTTP GET, PUT, POST etc. would have to kept open but could then be used to push information in the other direction.\r\n\r\nThink of a multi-repsonse GET request. Super convenient to work with from developers point of view on both ends of the connection. No extra protocol needed, no extra syntax to learn. Just multiple responses to the same GET request, either on an `on change` or a periodic basis, limited to a certain rate by either the client or the server.\r\n\r\n**Use-case 1 - chat messages**\r\n```\r\nSUB /messages/\r\n```\r\n\r\ninitial response\r\n```\r\n290 OK\r\n```\r\n\r\n1st data response\r\n```\r\n200 OK\r\n[\r\n  \"foo\",\r\n  \"bar\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n2nd data response (100ms later)\r\n```\r\n200 OK\r\n[\r\n  \"foo\",\r\n  \"bar\",\r\n  \"boo\"\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\netc."

    "body": "Currently, `Proxy-Status` draft defines only a single catch-all `http_request_error` error type for all issues with HTTP requests, and piggy-backs on the `4xx` status codes (`400`, `403`, `405`, `406`, `408`, `411`, `413`, `414`, `415`, `416`, `417`, `429`) for the exact reason as to why the request failed.\r\n\r\nThis is a bit inconsistent with the detailed error types it defines for issues with HTTP responses (`http_response_incomplete`, `http_protocol_error`, `http_response_header_block_size`, `http_response_header_size`, `http_response_body_size`, `http_response_transfer_coding`, `http_response_content_coding`, `http_response_timeout`).\r\n\r\nBut more importantly, it means that the `Proxy-Status` header isn't self-contained and it forces recipients to look in 2 places (`Proxy-Status` header and status code) to get the reason of the failure, and to take any action (log the error, etc.).\r\n\r\nWhile duplicating the information between `4xx` status codes and `Proxy-Status` type isn't ideal, the self-contained header seems to be worth it, IMHO.\r\n\r\nCurrent draft:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 411 Length Required\r\nProxy-Status: http_request_error\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis proposal:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 411 Length Required\r\nProxy-Status: http_request_length_required\r\n```\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\ncc @alyssawilk @mnot"

If I tell folks from Day 1 that the value _must_ be parsed as a parameterized list, it allows this to be extended further down the line despite that there's no parameters defined right now.\r\n\r\nThis led me to wonder... well, is this even a good idea? It seems reasonable to try and keep things open for future extension.\r\n\r\nThis led me to my second thought: is there ever a point to *not* parse lists as if they were parameterized lists. The implication is that any of these headers can always be more easily extended."

Many (if not most) popular programming languages will use 'serialize' in their spelling.

If input_item is a string, return the result of applying\r\n>        Serialising a String (Section 4.1.8) to input_item.\r\n> \r\n>    4.  If input_item is a token, return the result of Serialising a\r\n>        Token (Section 4.1.9) to input_item.\r\n\r\nI am currently writing a [javascript implementation](https://github.com/evert/structured-headers), where there is no real native 'token' type (I suspect that this is true for most languages).\r\n\r\nI'm curious, as an implementer, what should I do with that sentence? I have a few options:\r\n\r\n1. Treat any string that can be represented as a token by serializing it as a token, but anything else as a string.\r\n2. Treat everything as a string and ignore the token\r\n3. Expose a sort of wrapper that marks certain strings as tokens.\r\n\r\nEven though I feel that 1 is the nicest user experience, I worry that this will cause issues for future use-cases of structured headers that explicitly demand certain members to be serialized as either a token or string.\r\n\r\nCan you give a recommendation on what I should do?"

    "body": "At IETF 104's HTTPWG meeting, @ekr raised concerns about the categorization of Client Hints as an active fingerprinting vector, claiming that they are in-fact passive, because (IIUC) they can be persisted beyond the point where the information was requested, and persisted for future requests on current and future sessions to the same host.\r\n\r\nMy response to that was that this is something origins already do with cookies today, and that Client Hints access can be monitored by browsers in similar ways to other active fingerprinting vectors. On top of that, Client Hints opt-in persistence is purged when the user deletes their cookies, and support is disabled when JS is disabled.\r\n\r\nTalking to @martinthomson, it seems like there's another concern around the fact that the hints change when the values does. That seems similar to me to various change events around the exposed values (which do exist for most if not all Client Hints features). Browsers can track CH value changes in similar ways to active fingerprinting vector change events, and treat registration as if the origin accessed the equivalent API and subscribed to receive future events. Similarly, browsers can also mitigate that change reporting in similar ways (e.g. omit the hints or lie about them in some cases).\r\n\r\n@martinthomson & @ekr - Does the above properly captures the concerns you raised? If so, do the mitigations make sense and properly address them?\r\n\r\nIf they do, I'm happy to modify the security & privacy consideration sections to reflect the above"

This is true for all of the examples in the spec, but perhaps you have other examples in mind for which that would not be the case?\r\n\r\nI know it is simpler for caches to not have to look at every field, but they can determine this from the metadata during the post-store non-critical path. In general, I don't think we should send redundant data on the wire unless absolutely necessary. It also runs the risk of reality distortion if the key (mistakenly) contradicts the metadata."

    "body": "HTTP/2 blocked renegotiation for a number of reasons. Among other\r\nproblems, as this document notes in section 1.2.3, there is no defined\r\nway to correlate application-visible renegotiation events\r\n(CertificateRequest) with HTTP/2 requests. In essence, the prohibition\r\nis a reflection of TLS+renegotiation being the wrong API shape for\r\nHTTP/2 (and most protocols).\r\n\r\nTLS 1.3 removed renegotiation, but added post-handshake client\r\nauthentication to replace some of renegotiation's use cases. This\r\nretains the problems above. However, with the feature renamed,\r\nRFC7540's prohibition no longer applies and we're stuck with an\r\nincompatibility between RFC8446 and RFC7540.\r\n\r\nPost-handshake authentication is optional in TLS 1.3 and advertised with\r\nan extension, but this is not sufficient. Most HTTP/2 clients are also\r\nHTTP/1.1 clients and TLS parameters are negotiated in parallel. An\r\nHTTP/1.1+HTTP/2 client that advertises the extension for HTTP/1.1 (see\r\nsection 1.2.2 of this document) also advertises it for HTTP/2.\r\n\r\nBy a strict composition of the existing specification text,\r\nHTTP/2-capable clients cannot offer post-handshake authentication to\r\nHTTP/1.1 servers.\r\n\r\nIn reality, existing HTTP/2 servers won't use this mechanism because no\r\none has defined a request correlation. Thus we can fix all this by\r\nclarifying that TLS 1.3 post-handshake auth is forbidden whether or not\r\nthe client offered it.\r\n\r\nIf some future use case comes up, it can define an overriding extension\r\nwith a correlation mechanism. It would already need to do so, because\r\nexisting clients wouldn't know about the correlation. This is unlikely\r\nto happen anyway because this document *is* that use case, and it\r\nalready defines a separate mechanism."

    "body": "From PING:\r\n\r\nWe're concerned about the privacy implications of moving these attributes to header values, specifically since header values are more likely to wind up in passive / middle man / etc logs. Existing approaches require active techniques, and so (partially) reduce the fingerprinting risk.\r\n\r\nThe most on point issue I can find addressing this issue is https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/215, but this isn't quite on point (does not address increased risk from moving to passive collection).\r\n\r\nI see the text added / modified in https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/commit/2ba199856ae926284fe868de7c257009f01fe3b8 that mentions that \"implementors can do otherwise for privacy\", but PING is uncomfortable with such text ( such text dissolve the point of the standard; a standard that says \"its w/in this standard to vary arbitrarily\", then all that is introduced is web compatibility problems for privacy oriented parties).\r\n\r\n* What discussion has been had regarding increased information leak into logs? \r\n* What measurements / data exists to suggest this is not a problem?"

    "body": "_From Alex R on list:_\r\n\r\nIf we are to standardize X-Cache, then we should be mindful of the trap\r\ncreated by early implementations that thought a single action value can\r\nadequately relay what has happened at the proxy:\r\n\r\n1. The obvious HIT and MISS actions came first.\r\n\r\n2. Then we quickly discovered that a \"we found it in the cache\" HIT\r\naction is often followed by a REFRESH action (and a resulting MISS from\r\nthe proxy-server traffic point of view). HIT_REFRESH... concatenations\r\nwere used to combat this.\r\n\r\n3. Realizing that even fresh cache HITs may become misses due to various\r\nprotocol requirements and internal problems, some added X-Cache-Lookup\r\nthat was dedicated to the first (and often critical for triage) cache\r\nlookup, depicting what happened to that HIT later in X-Cache.\r\n\r\n4. Then flash crowds and collapsed forwarding solutions came along. Now,\r\na single client HIT or MISS request could cause even more transactions,\r\nsome of which could be cache hits, some could be revalidations or even\r\nerrors. Some added COLLAPSED_HIT_REFRESH... and/or other variants. This\r\nconcatenation approach still loses a lot of info, but it highlights the\r\nfact that a lot of info could be lost by including the COLLAPSED tag.\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is to standardize the current status quo, then the\r\ndocument should cover Cache-Lookup and COLLAPSED tags (and/or their\r\nvariations).\r\n\r\nIf the goal here is to standardize a scalable solution based on the\r\ncurrent experience, then we should combine Cache-Lookup and Cache while\r\nenumerating individual cache actions as separate same-node entries\r\n(instead of trying to merge them into a single FOO_BAR_BAZ super-action\r\nsummary for one node)."

    "body": "The way HTTP/2 dependencies work requires the client and server to maintain dependency trees that are (at least somewhat) in sync.\r\n\r\nWhen the client starts a new stream as a child of an existing stream it provides the parent stream ID. If the parent stream ID is unknown to the server then the dependency information is [thrown away and the stream is given a default priority](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-5.3.1).\r\n\r\nIn practice this is causing racy issues with Chrome's dependency tree and some server implementations. Chrome attempts to build a linear list of streams with each stream exclusively dependent on the stream before it. Higher priority streams are placed in the list ahead of lower priority streams. Each stream is also assigned a weight that maps to Chrome's internal \"priority\" though the weight is largely inconsequential when the dependency ordering is working because each request is always exclusively dependent on the parent in a list.\r\n\r\n![start](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975374-6f48e980-14bb-11e9-85fe-5c17e848f6ff.png)\r\n\r\nWhen a new stream is initiated that is a higher priority than the end of the list it is attached as an exclusive dependent of the last stream in the list with a higher priority (inserting it into the ordered priority list):\r\n\r\n![insert](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975460-a7e8c300-14bb-11e9-9d0b-3cb4af50b687.png)\r\n\r\nThis is where things get racy. If the server has already sent the last part of the new parent stream but the bytes are in-flight and the client doesn't know the stream has closed yet it is possible that the server no longer knows about the parent stream that the new stream is trying to attach to. When that happens, the new stream is given a default priority (weight 16 and attached to the root).\r\n\r\n![after](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/444165/50975592-f6965d00-14bb-11e9-91c3-797a0f9b9fe8.png)\r\n\r\nAt this point, what was supposed to be a high-priority stream inserted ahead of streams 5-9 is now a parallel stream with a MUCH lower weight, effectively starving it and largely delaying it until all of the requests in the original list complete.\r\n\r\nThis issue was exposed with my initial [HTTP/2 prioritization test](https://github.com/pmeenan/http2priorities) which flagged both Google's and h2o's HTTP/2 implementations as not working because the race condition was being triggered. I don't know how often it happens in the wild.\r\n\r\nh2o has mitigated the issues somewhat by remembering a set number of completed streams, reducing the likelihood that a completed stream will be needed as a parent but it is still possible to trigger depending on the size of in-flight buffers and the size of the high-priority requests (a lot of small streams and large buffers can still exhaust the dead-stream list).\r\n\r\nAdding support for something like a FIN ACK from the client when a stream completes and only deleting streams on the server when ACK'd should at least make it deterministic.\r\n\r\nAs the HTTP/3 spec is being finalized, it might be worth considering if a stateful dependency tree is really needed or if a stateless prioritization scheme more similar to what SPDY originally used might be easier (both for servers and browsers)."

    "body": "We're looking at shipping a version of Signed Exchanges (https://github.com/WICG/webpackage/issues/350; designed to expect more changes in the future, of course) that uses the draft `Variants` header. In https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomson-http-mice-03#page-4, we specify that implementations of the MICE draft use digests named `mi-sha256-##`, so `mi-sha256-03` for draft-03. Variants does not yet specify anything like this, which introduces a risk that we'll unintentionally introduce uses of the current draft into the wild, which could make it harder to change in the future.\r\n\r\nI'll send a PR to suggest that draft implementations use HTTP headers named `Variants-05` and `Variant-Key-05` later this week, if you don't mind."

MUST do when a server violates one of its MUSTs.\r\n* I removed the (incorrect) `token / \"/\" / \"?\" / \"\\\" / \"[\" / \"]\" / \":\" / \"@\" / \"(\" / \")\"` definition of available-value in favor of allowing arbitrary [Structured Header strings](https://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html#string). It wasn't clear what excluding characters like `{` was gaining us, and the restriction would have required extra words when parsing the headers.\r\n* I removed {{gen-variant-key}} entirely and had Compute Possible Keys return a list of lists that could be directly compared against the Structured Header parse of `Variant-Key`. It would be difficult to keep the old behavior of returning a list of strings without re-adding some restriction on an available-value, for example by requiring that they don't contain spaces.\r\n* I simplified Compute Possible Keys a bit."

As a known use case, websites that offer multiple languages may allow a user to set a cookie which determines which language. When that value is not present in a cookie, the server falls back to using Accept-Language or some other alternate.\r\n\r\nI think this specification should perhaps make some clarity over Cookies doing this kind of override, even if it may fit into the Vary section (as servers implementing this probably are using `Vary: Cookie`)"

    "body": "In https://github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews/issues/320, @annevk (re-)raised the question of Client Hints' integration with CORS. One suggestion in that thread is to prefix headers with `Sec-CH-`, which on the one hand makes them trivial to add _en masse_ to the CORS-safelisted list, and on the other prevents JavaScript from setting their values (which in turn limits the risk associated with adding them to the CORS-safelisted list in the first place).\r\n\r\nI have two concrete proposals for hints ([`UA-*`](https://github.com/mikewest/ua-client-hints) and [`Lang`](https://github.com/mikewest/lang-client-hint)) that adopt this pattern. Perhaps it's one that could be baked more deeply into the Client Hints infrastructure?\r\n\r\n/cc @igrigorik @yoavweiss @arturjanc"

A CDN which requests certs on behalf of its customers can do the same thing, adding an extra domain owned by the CDN to each certificate.\r\n\r\nIn the more complex case, customers create certificates with RPD=\"coalesce.cdn.com\".  Now any customer's certificate can be coalesced onto any connection to the CDN *provided that* the CDN first presents a certificate for \"coalesce.cdn.com\" where RPD is either the primary certificate or \"*\".\r\n\r\n(One comment which has been raised in offline discussion:  Some origins might not want the CDN name human-readable in the certificate.  CDNs could address this by using a less-branded domain, but we could also address this in the extension design by using hashes of domain names if desired.)"

    "body": "I have personally had an especially difficult time tying the purpose and usefulness of the `Content-DPR` client hint to a specific use case, and I don't think I'm alone in this. While the spec at large is straightforward and reads well, I think `Content-DPR` could benefit from a concrete example of how it might be used by the client. Currently, the spec says the following of `Content-DPR` in [section 4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-06#section-4):\r\n\r\n> The client can use this information to perform additional processing on the resource - for example, calculate the appropriate intrinsic size of the image resource such that it is displayed at the correct resolution.\r\n\r\nThis seems a bit vague to me. Does Chrome act on this response header a specific way? Are implementing browsers _expected_ to? And what's a specific example where that may be the case? Does any suboptimal behavior result when DPR is _not_ confirmed with `Content-DPR`, and if so, what instances?"

A new set of policy-controlled features – one for each Client Hint header field – is defined in the Client Hints spec. Those are defined in this PR.\r\n2.

The only way this would make sense is if it was French content aimed at English speakers (e.g. a French course for English speakers) but that's a bit of an edge case so presume that is that the intention here? Shouldn't the Content-Language either be fr, or the Content be in English so they match? It looks like it was in previous drafts but then it was flipped around, so not sure if this got missed or if I'm completely missing the point.\r\n\r\nMoving on we have the new example using the same request:\r\n```\r\nGET /foo HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\nAccept-Language: en;q=0.5, fr;q=1.0\r\n```\r\nand the new response with the additional proposed syntax:\r\n```\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nContent-Language: en\r\nVary: Accept-Language\r\nVariants: Accept-Language;de;en;jp\r\nVariant-Key: en\r\nTransfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n\r\n[French content]\r\n```\r\nHere it says there are German, English and Japanese versions (and no French version), and I've decided to send you the English version, and then it gives French content? Again should this be `[English content]`?\r\n"

If there is a TLS-terminating proxy intermediating the connection, the expected value will not match the received value, and the work of producing exported authenticators can be skipped.\r\n\r\nOne open question is around the use of early exporters.  I think this is probably something we want, so that servers can send additional certificates in their 0.5-RTT flight to 0-RTT clients.  However, should clients be required to supply a value derived from a regular exporter after the handshake finishes?  This is a minor pain in H2, but in HTTP/QUIC would require defining a separate frame type to carry the updated token.  The obvious value is that the server could still validate the token after forgetting the 0-RTT secret, but it seems like the server could as easily validate the setting early and remember the result even after discarding the secret.  Is there any additional security benefit to the client re-proving the connection is end-to-end after the handshake completes?"

    "body": "Suggestions from http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2018AprJun/0238.html:\r\n\r\n> 2.3.1 contains two lead-ins to the list.  I think that the processing\r\n> order is a little misleading.  In particular, the second lead-in\r\n> doesn't say that Expect-CT is present.  You want to say something like\r\n> \"If a host is CT-qualified, then process a response that contains a\r\n> Expect-CT header field in one of the two following ways:\"\r\n> \r\n> Overall, I think that 2.3 could be structured differently.  This\r\n> section includes cases for when the Expect-CT header field is\r\n> malformed (equivalent to not being present) as well as for when the\r\n> host is CT-qualified.  I would move the processing for absent and\r\n> invalid Expect-CT header fields into another section that simply says\r\n> that no change is made to the value of \"Expect-CT metadata\" for that\r\n> host.  Then you only have to worry about updating Expect-CT metadata -\r\n> which can be moved to 2.3.2, and reporting, which deserves its own\r\n> section.\r\n> \r\n> Something like:\r\n> \r\n> - Responses Without Expect-CT\r\n>   When the header is absent or malformed, the status of the host is\r\n> unchanged.  That is, any Expect-CT metadata for the host is unchanged.\r\n> \r\n> - Updating Expect-CT Metadata\r\n>   The Expect-CT header field is ignored if a connection is not\r\n> CT-qualified (see previous section), but it might generate a report\r\n> (see next section).\r\n>   If the connection is CT-qualified, then CT-metadata is created or\r\n> updated for the corresponding host based on the value of the Expect-CT\r\n> header field.\r\n> \r\n> - Reporting Expect-CT Problems\r\n>   If a connection is not CT-qualified, but the Expect-CT header field\r\n> is present and contains a report-uri, then a report is generated\r\n> (Section 3).\r\n\r\n> For 2.4, I would start by saying that when evaluating a connection,\r\n> the UA determines if the UA is a Known Expect-CT Host.  It does this\r\n> by looking for records that aren't expired.  Then talk about the extra\r\n> checks.  The current arrangement of paragraphs doesn't have a\r\n> consistent flow, it's currently: extra-checks, expiration, not\r\n> CT-qualified, more on reporting for not-CT-qualified hosts,\r\n> extra-checks again, disabling CT.  The bit on disabling CT belongs\r\n> elsewhere, I think, because it risks being missed."

    "body": "Much of the text of \"3.3 Rich Functionality\" discusses the merits of granular uris, but in one fell swoop it dismisses post/single-uri pattern as benefiting from only a very short and finite list of features: message framing, and availability of implementations.\r\n\r\nI find the former convincing, but the latter dismissal rather unconvincing.. it gives the air of being a complete argument but leaves out a lot of valuable other things even in a mere tunnel case - e.g. proxy support, varied authentication schemes, content negotiation, language negotiation, multiplexing  in h2, alt-service routing, coalsecing, and cross-origin policy enforcement in a browser, etc... These are reasonable motivators and you might be underselling the value of high quality available implementations for all aspects of the ecosystem including load balancers.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this could be more focused on the merits of URI design rather than saying - if you don't find that a match don't use http.\r\n\r\nand the bullet about \"The ability to interact with the application easily using a Web browser\" might be clarified to mean in a linkable/browsable/discoverable sense rather than excluding a fetch based API for it.."

    "body": "During the implementation of the [Cache Digests reference implementation](https://github.com/yoavweiss/cache-digests-cuckoo) I [realized](https://github.com/yoavweiss/cache-digests-cuckoo/commit/3ee4a45bf0bc03ea47ae7125e409b41d57acb198) that the digest size has to be a power of 2. Otherwise the `xor` operation on the primary index can lead to an out-of-bounds write, resulting in memory and correctness issues.\r\n\r\nAn alternative to that approach would be to:\r\n* Do an out-of-bounds check to the `xor` operation and if it is out-of-bounds, take as an index the out-of-bounds value minus the digest size.\r\n* Add a bit to the fingerprint which indicates that the alternative index was out-of-bounds.\r\n* In the future, when a fingerprint is displaced and need to be returned to the primary index, the \"out-of-bounds\" bit can be used as an indication that the original `xor` operation was out-of-bounds, and instead of the index, the `xor` operation now can use the original out-of-bounds index.\r\n\r\n@kazuho - Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nIt will cost us a bit more space (extra bit per fingerprint), but will make the digest size significantly more flexible.\r\n"

That's just something people will need to discover for themselves.  Generally, you have to decide whether you want 0-RTT without seeing any of it.  Partly this is because it avoids a potential deadlock, but mostly it's because the TLS stack will not even decrypt 0-RTT if it is rejected."

It could do this by using the # construct in the ABNF for those types, but because the parsing algorithm in structured headers isn't actually driven by the ABNF, I'm not sure that's the right approach.\r\n\r\nThe parsing side is already handled by http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/draft-ietf-httpbis-header-structure.html#text."

I think, for strict same site cookies at least, this perhaps needs tightening up.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

Servers respond with `USE_CERTIFICATE`.\r\n\r\nKnown drawbacks:\r\n  - Since `USE_CERTIFICATE` has to be sent in order, if the client requests a batch of domains, the server can't provide the requested certificates out-of-order (though it can outright reject some of them).\r\n  - This is fine for H2; in HTTP/QUIC, we'll need to decide if this is still zero, or if it's 3/4, or something else."

It appears that anything under httpwg.github.io/http-extensions redirects to httpwg.org/http-extensions, but not all content is actually mirrored there, as I get a 404 when following the redirect.\r\n\r\nNot sure how the mirroring is currently accomplished, so I'm not sure how to suggest fixing it."

This is rather awkward.\r\n\r\nHowever, the alternative is also somewhat unappealing.  In the process of updating #480, I'm adding a suggestion that servers SHOULD respond to `REQUEST` with an appropriate certificate if they have one, which makes this flow much cleaner.  However, there's current no way to *reject* a certificate request without a request stream."

    "body": "For memento datetime negotiation using the `Accept-Datetime` header, as specified in [RFC7089](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7089), the list of values for `available-value` would typically be too large to convey by-value in the `Variants` header. That is because resource versions with many different datetimes can exist in both resource versioning systems and web archives. In order to convey all  datetime values that could be used for datetime negotiation, an approach to provide these values by-reference rather than by-value would be required. Currently, I assume that datetime negotiation is the only negotiation for which this problem exists but with explorations of other negotiation dimensions on the way (e.g. [fine grained content negotiation](https://ruben.verborgh.org/articles/fine-grained-content-negotiation/)) that may change."

    "body": "The security issues motivating CSP Cookie Controls (https://www.w3.org/TR/csp-cookies/) still exist.   We at a minimum we should list this as a security consideration.   In particular, an origin is unable to restrict non-HTTP APIs from setting cookies on a host or domain.  While perhaps this is a nice-to-have for hosts (APIs operating in the origin context can do lots of other things), it is a major problem unique to cookies for domains.  \r\n\r\nA multi-tenant domain (with independent origins under it) has no in-band way to prevent cookies from being set on the entire domain (ie, to restrict cookies to same-site).  The only option available there is to put the domain on a public-suffix list which isn't always scale-able or operationally maintainable.\r\n\r\nIt may also be worth considering a response header that servers could send to constrain all cookies to same-site as part of this, either with \"Content-Security-Policy: cookie-scope host\" or as a separate response header specific to this use-case.  For example, a \"Restrict-Cookies\" response header with tokens matching the new features of 6265bis (same-site, secure-only, none) that would constrain behaviors of non-HTTP APIs.\r\n"

Servers can look for bad DNS records or BGP hijacking to detect attacks without ORIGIN, but now those techniques don't work.  In particular, key compromise is a concern; misissuance is perhaps less of a concern.\r\n\r\nSecondary certificates makes the entire situation worse.\r\n\r\nIn particular, it means that you can get a standalone certificate for the victim.  Previously, with coalescing, you would need to have a certificate that has both your own origin and the victim's origin, so that would be visible in a CT log.\r\n\r\nSubcerts can help with this (they have much shorter lifetimes)."

    "body": "Having ETags as part of the digest key adds a lot of complexity to the Cache Digest implementation both on the client and the server:\r\n* Clients may not have the ETag readily available at removal time, which would mean removal from the digest introduces I/O operations and slowness.\r\n* Servers may not have the ETag readily available when they want to send down push promises, forcing them to make those conditional on I/O operations (and again, slowness).\r\n\r\nI [ran an HTTPArchive analysis](https://discuss.httparchive.org/t/cacheability-of-render-critical-resources/1278) and it seems that from the render-critical resources that are push candidates, 77.26% of them are cacheable for at least 24 hours.\r\nSame query with 30 days minimal freshness gives us 52.32% of the resources.\r\n\r\nSo it seems that servers can in many cases have enough render-critical resources to push even without the ETag info.\r\nTherefore I suggest removing it, to simplify implementations. If we'd see that it becomes an issue in the future, we could add it back as optional.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

For example, by URL being the only source of the hash function, a H2 proxy that just holds a list of preload URLs can determine which ones in the list needs to be pushed, _and then_ fetch them from origin servers to push them."

    "body": "This foremost relates to the arbitrary limits that cookie stores place on cookies, both globally and per-domain.\r\n\r\nRFC 6265 says the following:\r\n\r\n>   At any time, the user agent MAY \"remove excess cookies\" from the\r\n>   cookie store if the number of cookies sharing a domain field exceeds\r\n>   some implementation-defined upper bound (such as 50 cookies).\r\n>\r\n>   At any time, the user agent MAY \"remove excess cookies\" from the\r\n>   cookie store if the cookie store exceeds some predetermined upper\r\n>   bound (such as 3000 cookies).\r\n>\r\n>   When the user agent removes excess cookies from the cookie store, the\r\n>   user agent MUST evict cookies in the following priority order:\r\n>\r\n>   1.  Expired cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   2.  Cookies that share a domain field with more than a predetermined\r\n>       number of other cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   3.  All cookies.\r\n>\r\n>   If two cookies have the same removal priority, the user agent MUST\r\n>   evict the cookie with the earliest last-access date first.\r\n\r\nWe did some investigation into this and discovered some problems with this process as implemented.  Browsers tend to remove a fixed number of cookies once they hit storage limits.  From what I can tell, browsers sort by last-access, but remove up to a fixed number of cookies.\r\n\r\nThis is bad for the integrity of storage.  Retaining some, but not all cookies is a great recipe for getting incomplete state. That can be a security exposure. That was part of what made some of the attacks in [this paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-zheng.pdf) possible and motivated the the [leave-secure-cookies-alone](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-leave-secure-cookies-alone) fix.\r\n\r\nWhen we looked at this we first concluded on the following algorithm:\r\n\r\n1. If cookies exceed the limit, remove all cookies for other domains (for `foo.example.com`, remove `(!foo).example.com` cookies, but not example.com cookies).\r\n2. If cookies still exceed the limit, remove all cookies for other paths (for `foo.example.com/foo`, remove `foo.example.com/(!foo)`).\r\n3. If cookies still exceed the limit, remove all related cookies (for `foo.example.com`, remove anything ending in `example.com`).\r\n\r\nOn review, I think that we can continue to use last-access date to drive this, with a much smaller change.  I'm proposing two small changes:\r\n\r\n* Require that last-access is set to the same value for every accessed cookie when constructing the Cookie header field (the text currently says the \"current date and time\".\r\n\r\n* Require that when an unexpired cookie is removed, require that all cookies that share a domain and have the same (or older) last-access date also be removed.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that if a site receives incomplete cookie state, then it is at least an incomplete state that might reasonably have been created by an adjacent site.  For example, say that `foo.example.com` installs and depends on cookies at `example.com`, then if `bar.example.com` triggers deletion, then it will remove only `foo.example.com` cookies.  It can't be perfect because there is a risk that `example.com` cookies are actually specific to `foo.example.com` and have an interdependency on `foo.example.com` cookies, but that's a risk we're already exposed to.\r\n\r\nThis can result in the same results as the algorithm I described above, but it also might allow for more granular removal.  For instance, if `1.example.com` through `9.example.com` are visited in that order and `9.example.com` causes cookies to exceed the limit, then cookies will be removed for `1.example.com` first The algorithm above would cause cookies for 1 through 8 to be removed at once, which is more severe than we need.\r\n\r\nAs the people driving this no longer work for Mozilla, I thought that I would record our conclusions.  I don't know if we have the resources to continue to investigate implementation, but I'm happy to create a PR for the relevant section if the WG thinks that this is a reasonable change.\r\n\r\nI understand that @mikewest still prefers [cookie priorities](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-west-cookie-priority), but no one at Mozilla has any interest in that solution and it didn't seem to get any traction when we discussed it before."

The potential for confusion about these is immense.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, there is no direct need for correlation between these.  This is largely because we hope that a response (or acceptance thereof) is largely conditioned on the set of certificates available, not the way that those certificate were requested, and so correlating CERTIFICATE_NEEDED isn't important.  (In light of this, the text on confusion of clients the the description of CERTIFICATE_NEEDED is just confusing to me.)\r\n\r\n* CERTIFICATE_NEEDED includes a Request-ID, which is also used in a CERTIFICATE_REQUEST.\r\n* CERTIFICATE_REQUEST includes an authenticator request, which also includes the Request-ID (and some extra entropy now).\r\n* CERTIFICATE includes a Cert-ID.  This is bound back to a CERTIFICATE_REQUEST using the contents of the authenticator itself (the exported authenticator \"get context\" API).\r\n* USE_CERTIFICATE includes a Cert-ID.\r\n\r\nThus, it is possible to follow the process full-circle, but it is generally not necessary.  A server should determine what response it wants to provide based on the certificates it has, not on how they were requested.  The same goes for a client that is accepting a response."

In current browsers it's therefore possible to tamper with the integrity of cookies marked with HttpOnly from JavaScript (e.g., XSS attack) despite the specification stating access should be restricted from non-HTTP APIs. \r\n\r\nIn my view we should protect both confidentiality and integrity for HttpOnly cookies, which could be done by adding a condition that cookies without the HttpOnly attribute should be evicted first when set from a non-HTTP API (e.g., JavaScript)."

In any organisation of non-trivial size it's likely that there will be a mixture of sites with report-only and enforcing policies. Thus, not all reports are equal. A failure of enforcing Expect-CT needs to be treated with urgency and perhaps an immediate action. Failures of report-only policies are not urgent and can be reviewed from time to time during normal working hours."

    "body": "Here's my use case: I am developing a testing tool (Hardenize), which analyses web site configuration and tries to determine if everything is in order. If I see Expect-CT on a site I need to know if the configured reporting endpoint is operational. It's all to easy for a reporting endpoint to break for whatever reason and without anyone noticing. I think this will be especially problematic for Expect-CT, which I would expect to be a \"quiet\" header.\r\n\r\nTo that end, I'd like to submit a test report and examine the response. For this to work properly, we need 1) an ability to indicate that a report is being submitted for testing purposes only and 2) for the server to be able to signal if the report is being accepted. With 1, the server can process the test response as it would a real one, but MAY delete it afterwards. With 2, the testing tool can determine if the endpoint is working correctly.\r\n\r\nFor #2, the RFC could be extended with section 3.3 Receiving a violation report, which could say that servers should respond with 200 if they are happy and able to receive a report for the indicated hostname, 4xx if there's something's wrong with the report (e.g., the indicated hostname is not known to the server), and 5xx if there is some other problem."

    "body": "While discussing this, I heard raised concerns that:\r\n* Adding cache digest support as currently specced may result in sending the digest even in cases where it is not used. Since initially this is likely to be most cases, shipping support is likely to result in performance regressions.\r\n* OTOH, a digest negotiation mechanism is likely to result in an RTT worth of delay before the digest reaches the server.\r\n\r\nA mechanism to solve this may look something like:\r\n* Client SETTING parameter that tells the server \"I'm going to send a cache digest, wait for it\". If this setting is not present, the server should not wait for a digest before pushing.\r\n* Server SETTING parameter that tells the client \"I really like to get a cache digest next time around\"\r\n* Client implementations SHOULD/MUST maintain server preference for future sessions, and MAY not send a cache digest if a past session with that server did not include a \"I want a digest\" SETTING parameter.\r\n* On the very first connection to a server, the client's cache is empty, so not sending the digest in that case has no penalty.\r\n"

The client might decide that it wants to abort and not provide a\r\ncertificate or something, but most implementations don't really allow that sort\r\nof messing around."

    "body": "The proposal for the _103 Early Hints_ response contains a few examples referencing (probably caching) intermediaries. For example, to trigger a h2 server-push when an origin sends a 103 carrying `Link` headers. However, there is no explicit definition on what a cache or proxy server may or may not do with 103 responses.\r\n\r\nBy definition, the informational response cannot have any own meta data:\r\n\r\n_\"A client MUST NOT interpret the 103 (Early Hints) response header fields as if they applied to the informational response itself\"._\r\n\r\nObviously, 103 is not among the status codes cacheable by default defined in [RFC7231 6.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.1). Furthermore the response cannot contain an entity body and it must be considered an intermediate response as the final response is still to come. I assume all that forbids storing the 103 in a cache.\r\n\r\nConsidering the objective to speed up Web site delivery, I would like to discuss the idea of adding a mechanism that would allow an intermediary cache to store data from the 103 response.\r\n\r\nIn a CDN-like setup an edge-server first receives an HTTP request and forwards it to the origin. Let's say the final answer took a long time, was private and could not be stored in the cache. However, a 103 intermediate response was received in the mean time and forwarded to the client. For subsequent requests to the same URL (according to the cache key calculation…) the edge cache could send the _cached_ 103 downstream to the client while the original request is sent upstream to the origin _at the same time_. I think this could be a very effective way to use waiting time.\r\n\r\nA similar situation was proposed at the end of section 2, where an _\"intermediary generates a 103 (Early Hints) response based on the header fields of a stale-cached response\"_. However, this can only apply to cacheable content. But HTML documents are most often private.\r\n\r\nTo avoid \"guessing\" in intermediaries, we could define a special Cache Control header field accompanying the 103 status, such as `Early-Hint-Control`. An origin could then define a 103 to be cacheable in a proxy server or cache. For subsequent requests the stored 103 could be sent downstream regardless of whether the final response is public or private.\r\n\r\nThe header field could follow the `Cache-Control` semantics. The `public` and `max-age=N` directives seem appropriate. A proxy server would have to store the Early Hint information apart from regular responses (e.g. 200) to not confuse it with a final response. When the field `Early-Hint-Control: public` is not present, the 103 response should not be stored."

    "body": "Based on https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/blink-dev/QHI3sio6--Q/v_zWX1O6AAAJ I have a couple of questions about the impact of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` as currently defined in https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-2.2.2\r\n\r\nThe main risk, touched upon in the [Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-client-hints-04#section-5) section, is the fact that providers of cross-origin subresources (e.g. images) loaded from pages with `Accept-CH` headers will start receiving fingerprinting-prone information about the configuration of a connecting client. Note that it will expose more information than what was available to these parties in the past because subresources such as images cannot use client-side logic to access information sent in Client Hints. A related issue is that based on the sets of headers sent in such subresource requests, the subresource owner might be able to identify the referring site even if it sets a Referrer Policy to prevent disclosing its URL or origin. For example, requests from a large site which sets `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer; Accept-CH: DPR` will be distinguishable from requests from sites with `Accept-CH: DPR, Viewport-Width` and from those without client hints. Depending on the chosen set of hints this can in practice uniquely identify the origin visited by the user.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of `Accept-CH-Lifetime` will extend this problem to all resources on a given origin -- if one page sets the header, then subresource requests from all pages in that origin will start carrying hint information. This can be undesirable for the user because it can disclose information about the visited origin and broadcasts fingerprintable information to all parties from which the given origin loads subresources.\r\n\r\nIt seems like this should be mitigated, possibly by one of the following:\r\n- (Preferably) Not broadcasting client hints on cross-origin subresource loads.\r\n- Obeying Referrer Policy and omitting hints if the referring page attempts to restrict data which is sent in the `Referer` header. Similarly, hints should probably also be stripped on HTTPS -> HTTP transitions."

While the size of an individual H2 frame is bounded and negotiated, the Origin set can seemingly be added to ad nauseam. Even in the default size case, for a short ASCII-Origin such as http://dk, if might be possible to create an Origin set with ~1500 entries. I like the fact that ORIGIN frame extension doesn’t need any negotiation, so perhaps some guidance for client-side implementations would help e.g. be aware of the Origin Set size and be prepared to close the connection if you’re getting unhappy."

Section 2.1 would be changed to contain two clearly labelled diagrams: one shall show the fields comprising an Origin-Entry, the other shall show the ORIGIN frame payload as an OPTIONAL sequence of Origin-Entries, with cardinality of 0-*. 0 indicates an empty ORIGIN frame, which is implied by the text in Appendix B - “inform the client that the connection is only to be used for the SNI-based origin, by sending an empty ORIGIN frame.”."

    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nMy name is Luis. I'd like to discuss with you a proposal to solve the following use case:\r\n\r\nCurrently, the only mechanism to share your location with a website is through the JS Geolocation API. This has some limitations: First, in order to have the server know the client’s location there are two full roundtrips required (one roundtrip to load the page with Javascript code, and a second roundtrip to actually send the location to the server and get back a location-aware response). While not as significant as the first limitation, the second limitation is that the client must execute Javascript in order to acquire location.\r\n\r\nFor example, for services like Search, it means that the very first response from a server will contain non-localized results, and a second roundtrip would be required to refresh those results (assuming Geolocation permission is already granted for the origin).\r\n\r\nThere's many ways to solve this problem through headers, so no JS would be required and clients could proactively include geolocation data in the very first request (after the server asked for it in previous sessions, and permissions are granted).\r\n\r\n[Here you can find a document detailing the problem and a possible proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zL4qyOpp6W36H4_eMpmth3Yj_ZTMZ3wCupc01q5qatA/edit)\r\n\r\nAfter discussing with @igrigorik he suggested that Client Hints might be a potential way to implement this too, which makes perfect sense. However, some features in the original proposal would not be possible with current CH draft (parameters for CH-Accept or path restrictions for when the data should be included).\r\n\r\nIt would be great to get your opinion on this and whether this is something that might be interesting for people in this working group.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nLuis."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that default semantics allow multiple headers with same field-name, as long as the field-value is defined as a comma separated list.. Meaning, there can be multiple Accept-CH header fields and they can be combined into a single list.\r\n \r\n> What happens if there is several \"Accept-CH-Lifetime\" on response?\r\n\r\nFor Accept-CH-Lifetime, I guess we just need to specify which one wins, correct? Any defaults I can point to or reuse? Last one wins?\r\n"

Expect-CT is checked at connection setup time, completely divorced from any context from which we can construct an `Origin` header.\r\n\r\nTherefore I think we need to resort to using `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for reports, if we want Expect-CT to be reasonably implementable in a web browser without violating the SOP.\r\n\r\n@scotthelme @mikewest @eranmes"

Right now, ORIGIN is defined to affect what the client is able to push, but (as above), the server doesn't have a firm idea about the origins that are actually valid to use on the connection at any given time. \r\n\r\nA number of potential solutions:\r\n\r\n1. The server just speculatively pushes and figures it out based upon the responses (i.e. no change)\r\n2. We create an explicit signal from the client to the server (e.g., \"I will process ORIGIN\", probably a SETTING, or \"I have processed ORIGIN\", probably a frame)\r\n3. ORIGIN doesn't constrain Server Push\r\n\r\nNote that 1 is not optimal (wasted bytes), and 3 might collide badly with future uses of ORIGIN."

    "body": "When investigating http extensions, I came across the `ORIGIN` frame draft here.\r\n\r\nAlthough I think the goals set out for it are good, there are some inherent issues with adding this extension:\r\n- Service exposure on servers: the `ORIGIN` frame will potentially expose previously unknown services on the same host (e.g. administration interfaces on different ports) that should not be advertised.\r\n- Shared-host exposure: the frame will (by design) expose other domains/hosts served by the same server. For shared hosts, this can cause severe privacy issues by exposing which other domains/hosts are served by the same server.\r\n- Origin IP exposure: unless explicitly filtered out, any reverse-proxied connection can expose the origin server's IP to a connecting client, due to the previous point's type of exposure. \r\ne.g. `example.com` is proxied, `example2.com` is not proxied. Connecting to `example.com` connects to the proxy, exposes `example2.com` also being hosted in the `ORIGIN` frame. Looking up `example2.com` in DNS then exposes the origin IP of `example.com`."

    "body": "Some potential (editorial?) issues with the Origin Set definition (Section 2.3):\r\n\r\n* For Host we may wish to use a better term than \"the value sent in Server Name Indication\".  In particular, this could cause problems in the future for any SNI-masking work.  This also has potentially weird interactions with DANE as it specifies that the SNI should be the terminal CNAME or SRV record target.\r\n\r\n* For Port, there is a weird interaction with Alt-Svc.  In particular, the server's port may be different than the port of Origin.  For example, an Alt-Svc for https://www.example.com to alt.example.com:8443 still has the origin of https://www.example.com:443 but given the current wording would have the incorrect initial origins set of https://www.example.com:8443\r\n\r\nWould it be better to have the implicit initial Origin Set from a client's perspective (when an ORIGIN frame is first received) be \"the origin (as per [RFC6454]) that resulted in the successful establishment of the connection\" ?   \r\n\r\nThis is ambiguous from the servers' perspective but perhaps much cleaner and simpler from the client's perspective.\r\n\r\nAnother ambiguity: if a 421 is received for the last origin in the Origin Set, does it become empty or return to uninitialized?  (Should we clarify the former, and that clients may wish to soon close out the connection if no new origin additions are received soon?)\r\n"

    "body": "The current ORIGIN frame draft (as of the changes introduced from #212) now prohibits consulting DNS when establishing a connection's authority, as long as the TLS certificate is consulted:\r\n\r\n> Clients MUST NOT consult DNS to establish the connection's authority for new requests.  The TLS certificate MUST stil be used to do so, as described in [RFC7540] Section 9.1.1.\r\n\r\nAs @MikeBishop pointed out during discussion in Chicago, this is the first draft that explicitly removes DNS from the loop as a factor, rather than just delegating DNS.  I did not get the sense that strong consensus exists yet for removing DNS as a factor without an additional authenticator.\r\n\r\nParticular concerns (some of which are highlighted in the Security Considerations) include:\r\n\r\n* When a cert (or validation behavior) is compromised, currently active MitM or DNS poisoning is required to exploit.  This new behavior enables vulnerabilities here to be exploited by simply getting a client to follow a link to a malicious server that can expand the ORIGIN set to cover the origins it wants to hijack (and which are covered by the compromised cert or compromised validation behavior).\r\n* This has the change has potential to significantly change the operational behavior of clients.  Rather than clients always following DNS, clients may now aggregate origins onto a connection to a server that was never handed out in the DNS for that name.  This may have unintended consequences, such as allowing a non-production server sharing a cert with a production name to accidentally hijack production traffic; or otherwise giving a server operator with a cert covering a name the power to pull in client traffic for that name without this being explicitly configured through the DNS.\r\n\r\nThis change (to not follow the DNS) also becomes much more powerful (and more useful and more potentially perilous) when combined with any future pushed certificate functionality.  I'm not convinced that the having to follow the DNS name is \"onerous\" enough to justify the security impact.\r\n\r\nSome options appear to be:\r\n\r\n1) Remove this \"Clients MUST NOT consult DNS\" clause.  This doesn't prohibit the expansion of ORIGIN sets, but does mean that existing DNS service discovery and DNS following behavior must still be followed.  This change could be introduced in a subsequent draft that much more explicitly worked through the security considerations and mitigations.\r\n2) Leave the language as-is, possibly expand on security considerations, and do a more detailed security analysis (especially for how this might interact with future pushed server certs).\r\n3) Specify additional mitigations that should replace consulting DNS, such as a pushed DNSSEC record chain terminating in the server IP, signed Alt-Service records, or similar.  Most of these would require subsequent drafts to define in-detail, along with a corresponding security analysis.\r\n\r\n(Regardless, we may wish to clarify the subsequent bullet to make it clear that clients MAY consult the DNS to determine whether an existing connection can be reused or whether a new connection should be established.  While the existing \"MUST NOT consult DNS\" phrasing does not prohibit this, it is misleading on a first reading.)\r\n"

Initialization means any origin that will soon be in the set but has not yet been processed will not be coalesced onto this connection even if it meets the rules of 7540.. that's the state that is intended at the end of origin set processing, but this interim state seems counterproductive.\r\n\r\nThe easiest thing to do seems to be to create some kind of checkpoint flag that means 'generation done for now'."

Alternatively, a client can treat advertised support as a persistent origin preference and append same header fields on all future requests initiated to and by the resources associated with that origin.\r\n\r\n\"All future requests\" is a long time indeed. While of course the client isn't going to literally do that (eventually it'll be garbage collected, or the user will reset state, or the machine will be recycled), from a server-side perspective, it'd be nice to have *some* level of control over how bloated your requests get.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, having `Accept-CH` possibly indicate that future references *to* **and** *from* this origin seems like a pretty broad brush to be painting with. While Chrome might make some reasonable decisions about tradeoffs here (and probably needs some wiggle room), if this ever does get implemented elsewhere, this broadness and freedom is a recipe for bad interop and worse server-side headaches.\r\n\r\nSo, can we nail this down at all? \r\n\r\nThe most conservative approach is:\r\n\r\n\"Send CH headers on subrequests generated by this content, please.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, the above also says \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server\" in the primary spot; the case above is relegated to \"optionally.\"\r\n\r\nPersonally, my preference would be to drop \"subsequent requests initiated to the same server and, optionally\" and the corresponding text in the example below it. The primary use case for CH as I understand it is serving appropriate subresources, NOT dynamically modifying HTML, so that should do the trick.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, @igrigorik?\r\n\r\nRegardless of that, \"server\" is used very loosely above; I think you mean \"origin\", right? And \"can\" should probably be \"MAY\".\r\n\r\nCC @yoavweiss"

    "body": "The [Accept-CH](http://httpwg.org/http-extensions/client-hints.html) header is currently included by origin servers in HTTP responses if they are interested in receiving client hints from the browser (e.g., DPR). The spec currently does not require browsers to persist the opt-in across browser restarts. This means that if the origins are interested in receiving hints on all requests, then they need to include the Accept-CH header on all responses. This has two disadvantages: (i) Browsers currently fail to include the hints on the first request after the browser restart; and, (ii) It may not be possible for the origin servers to include the Accept-CH header on all responses due to responses being served out of different endpoints (CDNs etc.).\r\n\r\nTo fix this: The Accept-CH header should also support a [max-age](http://wicg.github.io/reporting/#max-age-member) header value which indicates for how long should the browser remember this opt-in (including across browser restarts). A value of max-age set to 0 should cause the browser to stop sending client-hints to the origin. As an example,\r\n\r\n`Accept-CH: feature1, feature2, max-age=86400`\r\n\r\nwould imply that the browser should include hints `feature1` and `feature2` for next 86400 seconds for that origin."

    "body": "It would be better to define the 'rs' (record size) parameter as the size of each ciphertext record (including the 16 byte tag for AEAD_AES_128_GCM).\r\n\r\nThat way a receiver can split the body into records without needing to add the algorithm-specific tag length. Then pass the bytes to a crypto library that does know details such as the tag length for a given alg.\r\n\r\nThis spec doesn't absolutely need alg agility as other algs would define their own content-encoding label. But it would be cleaner (& safer) if future algs could follow exactly the same pattern and same body format by simply defining a new content-encoding label. The format is very close, with the need to add 16 to 'rs' being the only wart."

Given that 2026 requires \"a high degree of technical maturity and by a generally held belief that the specified protocol or service provides significant benefit to the Internet community\" and in light of the doubt around the use of this format, it seems like Proposed Standard might be more appropriate. Also, we'd need to document the implementations.\r\n\r\n* @reschke - If you have direct, personal knowledge of any IPR related to this document, has it already been disclosed?"

    "body": "Current spec is using Golomb-coded sets as the algorithm to create digests.\r\n\r\nWhile they show great space-efficiency, Golomb-coded sets do not enable O(1) removal from the digest, which means from a browser implementation perspective, the browser would have to calculate the hash for each host upon connection creation.\r\n\r\nThat poses a couple of issues from an implementation perspective:\r\n\r\n* Calculating the hash on each connection establishment may be expensive. That part seems inherent to the algorithm and not likely to be optimized away.\r\n* Calculating the hash requires per-host indexing. That part is just a limitation of many current cache implementations.\r\n\r\nA cache digest algorithm that enables O(1) removal (as well as addition) to the digest would enable us to move away from those limitations:\r\n\r\n* Browsers can calculate a per-host digest once, then keep updating it as resources are added to the cache as well as when resources are removed from the cache. No need for per-host indexing.\r\n  -  In order to do that, browsers would need to persist digests along with the cache\r\n* Upon connection establishment, the browser can just send the ready-made digest to the server. Win!\r\n\r\nDuring the HTTPWS, counting bloom filters were mentioned as an O(1) removal algorithm, but they are extremely inefficient when it comes to space. (~4 times bigger than bloom filters)\r\n\r\nTurns out, [Cuckoo filters](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~binfan/papers/login_cuckoofilter.pdf) enable O(1) removal while being more space efficient than bloom filters. While they are slightly bigger than Golomb-coded sets based digests, the cheaper runtime costs can make up for that deficiency.\r\n\r\n/cc @kazuho @mnot @cbentzel @mcmanus\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The entire gamut of possible solutions is broad, and we haven't had much luck in reaching clarity here.\n\nOne the one end of the scale, it should be perfectly OK to send a request for an `http` origin over an authenticated TLS connection.  But we still have the (entirely legitimate) concern there is that some servers might get themselves confused by this.\n\nThe other end of the scale is the bells and whistles JSON stuff.  @mcmanus seemed OK with this based on his implementation experience, but it is a little complicated.  We found too many corner cases for me to be happy that it implementations wouldn't end up busted.  And now that we insist on authentication for the server, many of the features didn't make sense.\n\nWe've also considered an HTTP/2 setting.  That's appealing, but it does limit the applicability a little.\n## This proposal\n\nThis change aims more to the conservative end of that scale.  It keeps the `/.well-known/` resource, but simplifies it, reducing it to a flat list of origins.  The client only needs to acquire this from the authenticated server.\n\nThis doesn't defend against Alt-Svc attacks mounted by attackers with the ability to both send header fields and run an authenticated server, but we're in a very strange place if this is the sort of capabilities we ascribe to our attackers in our threat models.\n## Other changes\n\nI've explicitly added `http/1.1` here.  I believe that's reflective of consensus, but that part is easy to revert.\n\nThe text about client certificates is now clearer.\n"

    "body": "Firefox and Tor Browser are introducing an [option](https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser/design/#idp55056352) to \"double-key\" cookies by (origin-domain|first-party-domain). (The first-party domain is defined as domain of the top-level document, visible to the user as the domain in the URL bar at the top of the browser.)\n\nWith double keying, it is possible for third-party cookies to be stored and retrieved, these third-party cookies cannot be used for tracking across websites.\n\nI think this policy is notable in that it keeps third-party cookies enabled but also prevents tracking. Thus third-party cookies function properly for many use cases. I would like to suggest adding this policy to the discussion of examples in RFC6265 section 7.1, \"Third-party cookies.\" After the sentence, \n\n> Others refuse to process the Set-Cookie header in responses to third-party requests.\n\nit might be of helpful to add something like\n\n> Still others store third-party cookies loaded by different first-party domains into separate cookie databases, to prevent cross-site tracking.\n"

    "body": "3] get rid of tls-commit (i.e. the latch to opp sec) as this plays very poorly with alt-svc. The notion of alt-svc has always been that it is a shortcut route (or dns name if your prefer) for the same content as supplied at the default origin. If for any reason you cannot get there, you can always go back to the default origin. All of the machinery around this (validating alternates, etc) can happen transparently and asynchronously in the background until they are ready to be used. A mechanism that requires a characteristic of a route (auth'd TLS) but not the route itself doesn't play well - its far too easy to brick your site for an extended period of time and really ceases to be opportunistic in any meaningful sense. If you're up to managing this, then you're probably up to the fight of running https:// and using HSTS which at least has the benefit of not bringing a whole second technology (alt-svc) into play.\n\n[there is further discussion on list]\n"

    "body": "As per recent discussion, this draft should advise readers about whether or not it should be used for new headers, or new parameters on existing headers.\n\nStraw-man:\n- Change the Abstract to:\n\n> RFC5987 defines an encoding for non-ASCII payloads in HTTP header field value parameters, based upon the encoding defined in RFC2231. This document updates that definition and describes how it should (and should not) be used.\n- Change the first paragraph of Introduction to:\n\n> By default, header field values in HTTP messages ([RFC7230]) cannot directly carry characters outside the US-ASCII coded character set ([RFC0020]). RFC 2231 ([RFC2231]) defines an encoding mechanism for use in MIME headers. This specification documents a subset of that encoding that has been used in some HTTP header fields. Its use in new header fields, or new parameters on existing header fields, is NOT RECOMMENDED.\n- Remove section 4 contents (and subsections), replace with:\n\n> The convention defined by this specification allows a parameter fields that have two possible encodings (ASCII without the `*`, UTF-8 with it). This causes considerable complication in the use and implementation of those parameters, since they now have to handle both, and all of the possible permutations and edge conditions implied by this (e.g., how a header field value with both ought to be handled).\n> Furthermore, this encoding can only be used in parameter values, not in other parts of header field values.\n> As a result, use of this encoding is only RECOMMENDED where already defined; new header fields, as well as new parameters on existing header fields, SHOULD NOT use it when non-ASCII content is anticipated. Instead, they SHOULD mandate a character encoding of UTF-8, combined with escaping of non-ASCII characters using a well-defined convention (e.g., percent encoding, as per [RFC3986).\n- Optionally, move the existing contents of section 4 into an appendix, but clarify that they're there merely for the benefit of existing uses.\n"

    "body": "Based on the various discussion at [IETF](https://github.com/httpwg/wg-materials/blob/gh-pages/ietf96/minutes.md#jfv), HTTP Workshop, and [mailing lists](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/httpbisa/current/msg26788.html), JFV may not be the right long-term \"replacement\" header encoding format. However, while [sketches are being pushed around](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JulSep/thread.html#msg292), it's not clear if and when such a format will come either… In the meantime, I believe we can shape JFV (with minor modifications) into a format that is immediately useful and addresses many of the current pain points for **new** header fields. Specifically: \n- UA's want a reusable and tested parser. Today we end up hand-rolling parsers for most every field (due to ABNF quirks, past implementation mistakes, etc), which leads to interop problems, security issues, and so on. Also, this is not a Chrome specific problem, all major UA's have the same pain points, and we all need to do better.\n- At the same time, all UA's have well-tested JSON parsers. Reusing existing code helps cut down on attack surface area, helps with interop, etc. As such, JFV format is a strong plus.\n- JSON parsers are easy to come by on the server side and all the same benefits and motivation is just as applicable.\n\nThat said, as others have already pointed out, we do need additional restrictions on JFV beyond what is currently in the spec. Also, it just so happens that browsers already follow the [ECMA-262 spec](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html), which addresses most of the  raised concerns:\n- Specify how to deal with repeated fields:\n  - [InternalizeJSONProperty(holder, \n    name)](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-internalizejsonproperty): \n    _\"In the case where there are duplicate name Strings within an object, \n    lexically preceding values for the same key shall be overwritten.\"_ All \n    browsers already do this.\n- Specify number encoding format\n  - [4.3.20 Number \n    value](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-terms-and-definitions-number-value): \n    Number value is primitive value corresponding to a double-precision 64-bit \n    binary format IEEE 754-2008 value.\n  - [11.8.3 Numeric \n    Literals](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-literals-numeric-literals)\n- Specify date encoding format\n  - [20.3.1.16 Date Time String \n    Format](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date-time-string-format), \n    [Date.parse()](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/#sec-date.parse)\n    - We can require ISO 8601 Extended format.\n- Specify character encoding\n  - UTF-8 [[RFC3629](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3629)]\n\nAre there other issues that were brought up that are not addressed above? \n\nMy proposal is that we update JFV to spec above ECMA-262 restrictions and requirements. Doing so would enable UA's to adopt JFV with minimal work.\n\n_p.s. in progress specs and browser features that plan on leveraging JFV: [Clear-Site-Data](https://www.w3.org/TR/clear-site-data/), [Feature Policy](http://wicg.github.io/feature-policy/), [Reporting](http://w3c.github.io/reporting/), [Network Error Logging](http://w3c.github.io/network-error-logging/), … and I'm sure we'll see more soon._\n\n/cc @reschke @mnot @mcmanus \n"

    "body": "In [section 3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-cookie-alone-00#section-3), after the line \"Before step 11, execute the following step\", the new step intentionally ignores the path.  A note says that \"The intent is to allow the 'secure' flag to supercede the 'path' restrictions to protect sites against cookie fixing attacks.\"  However this change breaks backwards compatibility in the following common scenario:\n1. https://example.com/login/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /login/.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nThis is the cause of https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=580770.  If the draft is adopted as currently written, it will effectively force any website that hosts secure and insecure applications under the same host name to rename cookies in each application to avoid conflicts.  To date, using path provided sufficient scoping to avoid cross-application conflicts.\n\nEven if the second cookie was allowed to be set in the scenario above, it would not have resulted in a fixation vulnerability because one path was not a path-match of the other.  It might be possible to fine-tune the algorithm to only block non-secure cookies if and only if a secure cookie already exists that is a [path-match](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.1.4) of the insecure cookie.  However, that assumes that the cookie order algorithm in https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265#section-5.4 is changed from SHOULD to MUST, and that servers only trust the first cookie.  It also wouldn't help improve backwards compatibility in this scenario:\n1. https://example.com/ sets a Secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /.\n2. http://example.com/foo/ sets a non-secure cookie named SESSIONID with the path /foo/, which will be ignored.\n\nBoth the draft as written, and the path-match variant proposed above suffer from fixation attacks when an HTTP resource is visited first.  There are other ways that these types of attacks can be mitigated without breaking backwards compatibility, and cover more attack scenarios, at the expense of being opt-in by the server.  These might include the __Secure- prefix (assuming no one is using this in the wild), or introducing a new cookie header, like Cookie-Attributes, that servers could inspect to determine whether or not to trust a cookie.\n"

Is the scope limited to the resources referenced in the stream and the client would have to keep a data structure around for every page?\n\nThere are a few cases where I can see issues with scoping on hostnames:\n1. If a user goes to www.example.com, you might want to expand the cache digest to all of the resources for example.com.\n2. The first point doesn't make sense for a site like Tumblr where there are many blogs for *.tumblr.com and creating a digest might become large.  Having a limit on the number of items in the digest and having the most used items in the cache digest might help.\n3. There are also issues for sites where there are multiple domain names referenced by the stream and being served by the same connection.  This will happen with finance.yahoo.com where it has s.yimg.com resources and they are served by the same server.\n\nFor reference:\n\"A CACHE_DIGEST frame can be sent from a client to a server on any stream in the \"open\" state, and conveys a digest of the contents of the client's cache for associated stream.\"\n"

Client hints are presumably sent on all requests, not just within contexts that currently allow execution of javascript via UA or site-specific policies. Hence, a site that does not allow javascript within certain frames (e.g., third party ads) will have no ability to similarly constrain the sending of client hints.\n\nIn short, the section should seriously discuss the privacy concerns rather than make a rather flippant comparison to existing problems with javascript fingerprinting. Assume, for example, that the user has already configured their browser to prevent fingerprinting via other means and teach what ought to be done for CH to do the same.\n"

Or only send them after an origin has opted-in with a .well-known/http-encryption response\nover a strongly authenticated connection?\n\nThe risk comes from an unauthenticated active adversary Alt-Svc'ing a client to a server\nto which the client is sending client certs for HTTPS but where the server is not\nmulti-scheme aware and hasn't opted in.  There is the potential for the server to\nhave a perception of HTTPS client-cert authenticated requests when the client may\nbe thinking it is making HTTP requests which may have had some cookies\nor other elements injected by the active MitM under the cleartext HTTP side.\n\nFrom @martinthomson on http-wg discussion:\n\n> I would be happy saying that you can't use client certs.  That is,\n> unless you were using them for HTTPS requests and the connection\n> happened to be shared.\n"

    "body": "Erik raises in post-WGLC:\n\nThe text is still a little unclear on whether commit then requires subsequent connections to use \"strong authentication\" or just \"authentication\".  In particular, Section 3 seems to add some confusion about whether \"reasonable assurances\" and \"server authentication\" are the same thing or not but then 5.2 sometimes uses \"authenticated without \"strongly authenticated\".  For example, this paragraph is not particularly crisp on what the requirements are (strong authentication or something else):\n\n```\nA commitment is not bound to a particular alternative service.\nClients are able to use alternative services that they become aware\nof.  However, once a valid and authenticated commitment has been\nreceived, clients SHOULD NOT use an unauthenticated alternative\nservice.  Where there is an active commitment, clients SHOULD ignore\nadvertisements for unsecured alternative services.  A client MAY send\nrequests to an unauthenticated origin in an attempt to discover\npotential alternative services, but these requests SHOULD be entirely\ngeneric and avoid including credentials.\n```\n"

    "body": "During the discussion of the Secondary Certs work, Nick S. raised the point that it would be interesting to be able to inform the client about dependent domains which are also served by this server as the server returns content that references it.  In order to do this incrementally, an ORIGIN frame would need to be additive -- each successive frame augmenting the client's list of allowed domains.  However, we still need to support the original case, scoping it down.\n\nI'd suggest changing the semantics to be additive and defining a flag whose presence/absence means that the existing list (initially inferred from the certificate) be discarded before processing this frame.\n"

I wonder, though, about the willingness to consider allowing for some extensibility.  Right now, someone saying \"save-data=on\" is signing up for pretty much anything.   Separating acceptance of data saving for different elements, e.g. agreeing to smaller video resources but not lower fidelity audio, seems like it may be useful.  I suggest that the working group consider making this an extensible field with \"save-date=all\" as the default, with semantics matching the current \"save-data=on\".  Then later extensions can be specified for more granular statements.\n"

    "body": "Kari has raised an interesting potential weakness with the dual use of .well-known/http-opportunistic.  The presence of the resource indicates support for cross-port Alt-Svc without strong authentication.  The presence of a commit member, however, indicates that only strongly-authenticated alternatives should be used (effectively, opting out of the weaker mode).\n\nHowever, since the commitment to strong auth has an explicitly stated lifetime, while the consent to cross-port doesn't, it's possible for the end result to be that a client believes the server has consented to weak cross-port alternatives after the commitment has expired.\n\nSeveral reasonable solutions exist:\n- Move the duration out to an explicit \"lifetime\" member which details the time for which the entire structure can be treated as valid; \"commit\" would effectively become a flag.\n- HTTP caching semantics might be used for the same purpose; \"commit\" still becomes a flag\n- Explicitly state a desired mode of behavior (strong-auth only, same-host only, same-host or strong auth, etc.) and optionally a lifetime.  This is harder to extend in the future, but may be the clearest today.\n"

    "body": "The resolution to #144 implies that the client can trust Alt-Svc headers from the server after finding a .well-known/http-opportunistic resource, but doesn't explain why that should be.\n\nLogically, the attack described depended on the attacker's ability, from hosted content, to inject a value for the Alt-Svc header.  The original solution in the Alt-Svc draft, saying that servers just shouldn't allow this, placed a retroactive requirement on servers that don't support Alt-Svc.  This well-known URI represents a clear signal that the server _does_ support Alt-Svc.\n\nI suggest we add the requirement that servers which advertise the .well-known/http-opportunistic resource MUST prohibit setting the Alt-Svc from unprivileged content.  This is a reasonable implication from the current state of the text, but is not explicitly stated and could easily be missed by a server implementer.\n"

This is done by including the optional \"commit\" member in the http-opportunistic well-known resource (see Section 6).\n\nThis does not make possible to specify \"commit\" without saying same time that  there is also reasonable assurance for alternative services for on same host which does not provide strong authentication.\n\nThere should be possible to give \"commit\" for authenticated alternatives WITHOUT giving also reasonable assurances for non-authenticated alternatives (on same host that origin).\n\n`/.well-known/http-opportunistic` SHOULD include separate indication that for reasonable assurances.

    "body": "As a part of discussion in whatwg/html#804 I've made a [research](http://inikulin.github.io/cookie-compat/) of the modern browsers compatibility with the RFC 6265. It appears that all browsers nowadays allows cookies without key or (in case of Safari) without value, thus making it de facto standard. However, it's debatable how cookies like `foo;` should be treated: as the cookie without value or without key. Thinking of cookie jar as some kind of key/value store makes it more logical to treat such cookie as cookies without value, but on the other hand, currently most implementers treats them as the cookies with the special empty key.\n"

    "body": "The spec currently says that clients should send CH headers \"based on their default settings, user configuration and/or preferences\". This needs to be more precisely defined in order to not cause interoperability problems between browsers.\n\nI know that there's a tension between not sending too much header data which is commonly not used by servers, thus wasting bandwidth, while also sending enough information that servers can optimize their responses. However leaving the decision out of the spec and up to clients, doesn't make the problem simpler, it just pushes it onto someone else.\n\nWhat I propose is the following:\nFor \"document\" loads, i.e. when browsers make the request during navigation, send the information which is typically needed for websites to determine what markup to serve. So things that let the server choose which version of a responsive-design page to serve first. I'd think this includes things like \"viewport-width\", \"downlink\" and \"save-data\". (We might also want to send other information like, is the device touch-enabled, but that's a separate discussion I think).\n\nFor non-\"document\" loads, serve no CH headers by default and instead let the \"document\" response opt in to which headers should be served for the non-\"document\" requests within that document. See also issue #155.\n"

    "body": "The spec currently says that if a server sends `Accept-CH: DPR`, then the `DPR` header should be added \"to all subsequent requests\".\n\nHowever it is (as far as I can tell) completely undefined what a \"subsequent request\" is. Does it affect only future requests to the server which sent the `Accept-CH` header? If the header is sent with the response during a document load, does it affect all requests coming from that document, no matter which server the request goes to?\n\nGenerally speaking, if a CDN which servers images has to send a `Accept-CH: DPR` header before it will receive any `DPR` headers, that means that the first image will have to be served without DPR information. This seems unfortunate since ideally the first image that a page loads is the most important image.\n\nA better solution is that when a browser loads a \"document\" and receives a `Accept-CH` header in the response, that header would affect all the requests that are made from that document, no matter which server the request is going to. If desired, in the future we could add more complex syntax to `Accept-CH` which enables opting in to certain CH headers only for certain servers and/or only for certain resource types.\n\nWe could also add a header which enables a server to opt in to getting specific CH headers for all future requests to that same server. To for example allow an image server to opt in to certain headers even if the document-serving server has not yet adopted the `Accept-CH` header. But I'm not sure how popular such a solution would be given first-load the problem mentioned above.\n"

Other popular proxy implementations offer similar functionality (Opera, Yandex, etc). It would be nice to have a standard way to do this, and to enable origins to report this as well. \n\nRelated discussions: \n- https://github.com/igrigorik/http-client-hints/pull/42\n- https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!searchin/blink-dev/alternate/blink-dev/lj7wSXPBPWE/fE5UGl_2y1QJ\n"

This is in many cases not sufficient, for example in the pad-to-next-power-of-two case.\n\nExtending the padding length to two octets will allow up to 65537 octets (65KB) of padding.\n\nI raised this on the ietf-http-wg list here:\n    https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JanMar/0171.html\n\nMartin [raises a good point](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2016JanMar/0175.html) about an upgrade path for existing users.

The two parameters specified in the Draft (\"ma\" and \"persist\") are certainly of that flavour. Or is the intention that parameters could be used for other purposes as well?\n\nIf the latter, perhaps the language in section 7.3 could be softened, e.g.\n\n> The HTTP Alt-Svc Parameter Registry defines the name space for parameter names. ...\n\nThe text at Section 3 currently launches into the following with no preamble:\n\n> # 3.  The Alt-Svc HTTP Header Field\n> \n> ...\n> This specification defines two parameters: \"ma\" and \"persist\", defined in Section 3.1.  Unknown parameters MUST be ignored, that is the values (alt-value) they appear in MUST be processed as if the unknown parameter was not present.\n> New parameters can be defined in extension specifications (see Section 7.3 for registration details).\n> ...\n\nHow about inserting a sentence along the following lines:\n\n> Each \"alt-value\" MAY be followed by a semicolon-separated list of additional parameters, each such \"parameter\" comprising a name and a value. This specification defines two parameters...\n\nOr, if you want to constrain the use of parameters in any way, you could do that here.\n"

    "body": "Amos raises:\n\n\"for use when a server operator has a received a legal demand to deny\naccess to a resource\"\n\nThis is a lot more restrictive than what I understood was being agreed\nto. This phrasing implies that a specific-URL DMCA type notice is\nrequired before the status may be used.\n\nIt would be a lot more reasonable to also allow the status to be used\nwhen a blanket law requirement was levelled on the operator. For example\nschools following laws on porn fitering, or national level restrictions\non categories of traffic. In cases like these operators dont receive\nper-resource demands, they often receive a one-off notice \"law X applies\nto you\" and are then expected to censor proactively to the best of their\nability and face the court on overlooked URLs.\n\nProbably this can be resolved with s/legal demand/legal requirement/.\n\nThere are other \"legal demand\" phrase uses elsewhere to keep in sync.\n\nIf \"legal demand\" is being used with a meaning other than a specific\nwarrant DMCA takedown etc. Then that definitely needs to be explained.\n"

    "body": "When the origin delegates to an alternate for 30 seconds, and the alternate delegates somewhere else (or to itself) for 7 days, how long does the client keep it?  30 seconds because that’s what the origin said, or 7 days because the alternate is supposed to be equivalent in authority to the origin?\n\nI'm inclined toward the second, since the alternate is supposed to be fully authoritative and since it enables use of an alternate to be persistent so long as you regularly visit the origin.  It feels odd to let a delegate grant itself more power than the delegation originally gave it, though....\n"

    "body": "Someone who controls any resource on an origin can issue directives that affect all resources on that origin.  (Thinking of the server the CS/CE students could work with in college, where we all had pages at server.example.edu/~username.)  Sure, I can’t change the host because I don’t have the server cert, but I can change ports without that requirement.\n\nThe guidance in 9.1 just says “don’t let people do that,” which is easier said than done on systems that already exist.  People can run apps listening on ephemeral ports, and people can control their home pages.  With this combination, everyone else's home pages can be hijacked unless the server admin reads this draft before any students do and promptly prohibits pages from emitting headers named Alt-Svc.\n\nThe way to partially fix this is to require strong auth for changes of port as well.  Resources can still slow down access by causing attempts to access an alternate, but the alternate won't be able to supply fake resources.\n"

    "body": "Alt-Svc tells me to use h2, so I open a TLS connection, and the server either doesn’t support ALPN or doesn’t select h2.  What now?  Weird corner cases ensue where I’m connected to something that may or may not be the alternate I was intending to reach.  (Similar issues ensue attempting to connect using h2c -- does it mean a direct TCP connection to the specified port, or that the client should offer Upgrade?  What if the server doesn't accept the Upgrade?)\n\nIt's simpler to just say TLS is the protocol and require ALPN support in 2.3 as well.  Point me to a TLS-enabled endpoint, and the specific protocols we'll use will be negotiated in real-time.\n\nHowever, this does pose a challenge if you wanted _only_ HTTP/3 traffic going to your alternate.\n"

However, it is unclear\nto me whether a parameter without \"=value\" should be ignored or\ntreated as malformed.\n\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 Section 3 refers to \"parameter\".\nSection 1.1 says \"parameter\" is defined in RFC7230.  In fact, RFC7230\nhas \"transfer-parameter\" but not \"parameter\".  Also, RFC7230 Section\nsays \"Parameters are in the form of a name or name=value pair.\",\nimplicilty allowing names without values, but in the next line\n\"transfer-parameter\" is defined as a name=value pair, which disallowes\nnames without values.  On the other hand, RFC7231 Section 3.1.1.1\ndefines \"parameter\" as a name=value pair, but this is not what\ndraft-ietf-httpbis-alt-svc-06 refers to.\"\n"

In this context, they imply a layering above TLS.\nWhen used outside this context, there is an ambiguity, mainly for the http/1.1 token: does it refer to HTTP/1.1 over TLS, or can it refer also to HTTP/1.1 over TCP?\nThe draft should resolve this ambiguity by stating that the http/1.1 identifier is used to identify HTTP/1.1 over TLS.\n\nIn addition, a new identifier, h1c for example, could be defined to identify HTTP/1.1 over cleartext TCP, in order to allow using Alt-Svc to be used to target an HTTP/1.1 server over cleartext TCP.\n"

    "body": "The current Alt-Svc-Used indicator is a boolean (\"0\"/\"1\"), due to the desire to preserve privacy.\nBased on some explorations of how this would be implemented on the server side, we realized that this doesn't provide enough information to distinguish between the different use-cases for Alt-Svc.  In particular, a server would have no way to know if just the protocol was changed, or if both the protocol and host were changed.  If we start using multiple Alt-Svc sources (such as DNS) this also becomes relevant.\n\nAn option short of including (proto,host,port) in Alt-Svc-Used would be to include a better indicator of how the Alt-Svc was used.  This could be either a bitmask or a string of tokens.  For example, with a bitmask:\n- 1 = Alt-Svc was used to change protocol  (ie, service proto != default origin scheme's proto)\n- 2 = Alt-Svc was used to change port     (ie, service port != origin port)\n- 4 = Alt-Svc was used to change host    (ie, service host != origin host)\n- 8 = Alt-Svc was obtained via Alt-Svc header\n- 16 = Alt-Svc was obtained via ALTSVC frame\n- 32 = Alt-Svc was obtained via DNS record  (reserved, not yet defined)\n\nWith a token approach, short character strings could replace the bitmask.\nIn either case this would result in a value like:\n\n  Alt-Svc-Used: 20\n  Alt-Svc-Used: h,f\n\nFor load-balancing, this would make it possible to infer the (proto,host,port) that may have been used in cases where it differs by use-case but is consistent within a use-case.\n\nThis would also significantly help with debuggability on the server side.\n### Editorial\n\nRegardless of how this is resolved, there is still text referring to previous Alt-Svc-Used indicator proposals that should be cleaned up to be consistent with whatever we decide on.  For example, with the current text the following is confusing and should be removed:\n\n>   To reduce the ability of servers to track individual clients over time (see <xref\n>   target=\"tracking\"/>), an alternative service indication sent by a client &SHOULD-NOT; include\n>   any alternative service information other than the protocol, host and port.\n\n(as the protocol, host, and port aren't part of what is being sent in the current indication).\n\nThe same applies of the \"Tracking Clients Using Alternative Services\" section which may be a remnant from previous versions.\n\nThe current text also mentions a \"token\" in the Alt-Svc-Used definition, but does not explain it or specify how it might be used or set.\n"

This document doesn't define any such checks, though clients\n>  could be configured with a policy that defines what is acceptable.\n\nis very unclear for a server implementer (as well as clients).  If authentication doesn't succeed, should the client fail-back to clear-text (the origin) or hard fail?\n\nOne possibility (which may start getting outside of the editorial realm) is for an Alt-Svc parameter indicating that authentication will not be present (either via an unauthenticated cipher suite or a mismatching cert).  This would allow clients to chose to ignore the Alt-Svc rather than following it and erroring or needing to fall-back).  For example:\n\n```\n Alt-Svc: h2=\":443\" ; unauth\n```\n"

An HTTP/1.1 server doesn't check the scheme, but permits authority form requests for both `http` and `https` equally.  Scheme is instead inferred from the presence/absence of TLS in the stack.\n2. Attacker sends an Alt-Svc header field to clients referencing the `https` endpoint on that server.  This can come from any resource on the `http` endpoint, so it might not require any MitM attack.\n3. Clients now make `http` requests to the secure endpoint and now the content from the `https` origin is entered into the `http` origin.\n\nDo we want to require an explicit indication from HTTP/1.1 servers so that clients can\nbe assured that this error did not occur?\n\nThis should not be a problem for HTTP/2.\n"
